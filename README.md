## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely

# Aim of the project

To run and play the Arcade game with the help of Object oriented java script.

# Cloning of the Project

1.  First we need to clone the project from the udacity blog.
2.  Then read all the files given in the project.
3.  We need to make the changes only in the app.js file.

## What I have done to this Project
1.  We need to resolve some errors in app.js file by running the index file in console.
2.  After resolving the errors we get the canvas of the arcade game.
3.  Then we need to add the player object and add enemy object to the canvas.
4.  Add movement to the enemies by using random() function.
5.  Add update, render methods for player object.
6.  We can give the movement to the player using arrow keys.
7.  After that we need to write the conditions for collison.
8.  We should check the conditions that the player object should not move out of the screen.
9. If the player collides with enemy, then the players position is retained immediately.
10. If the player reaches the water layer,then the players position is retained after 200ns.

### Conclusion

1.  From this project I have learnt Object oriented JavaScript.
2.  I learnt how to implement the objects and functions.
3.  I have learnt how to work with Canvas.
4.  I have learnt different ES6 functionalities.
